# FaceTrack-Attendance

<h1>Face Recognition Attendance System </h1>
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<h3>This project implements a face recognition-based attendance system using AI and machine learning. The system leverages the college's camera to capture images of students, identifies their faces, and marks their attendance accordingly. Additionally, it sends a daily attendance report to the students via email.</h3>

<h1>Features</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Face Recognition: Utilizes AI and ML algorithms to identify and recognize students' faces.</li>
  <li>Automated Attendance Marking: Automatically marks attendance for recognized students.</li>
  <li>Email Notifications: Sends daily attendance reports to students via email.</li>
  <li>User Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to manage and monitor attendance records.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Programming Language: Python</li>
  <li>Libraries: OpenCV, dlib, face_recognition, NumPy, pandas</li>
  <li>Machine Learning: Pre-trained face recognition models</li>
  <li>Email Integration: smtplib, email.mime</li>
  <li>Database: SQLite/MySQL (Choose one based on your implementation)</li>
</ul>
